# Target Audiences & Approach
Our stakeholder engagement strategy involves tailored outreach to policymakers and international organizations.

## International Organizations - Website
To kickstart our efforts, we will establish a website dedicated to disseminating our research study and initiating fundraising for the launch of an NGO or finding a host. Our NGO will specifically concentrate on implementing projects within a women-only work environment, complete with childcare and transportation facilities.

## Taliban - NGO
Recognizing the impracticality of directly approaching policymakers as individuals without offering tangible benefits, we plan to engage them through the NGO. Our appeal will advocate for the employment of women in a women-only work environment, supported by religious and financial arguments. In this presentation, our focus will be on financial arguments, as they bear a direct relevance to our study.
- ### Religious Arguments:
Khadija, the wife of Prophet Muhammad PBUH, was a businesswoman
Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab appointed Ash-Shifa to be market inspector who inspects the scales and transactions to be just and accurate. 
Ash-Shifa bint Abdullah used to go out to teach the Muslim women to read and write and to practice medicine during the lifetime of Allahâ€™s Messenger.
While not an obligation, morally and ethically, supporting one's husband and family is highly imperative, earning double the reward compared to spending on charity.
Earning income legally is a compulsory duty in Islam, prohibiting the acquisition of illicit money and forbidding begging.

- ### Financial Arguments:
As the Taliban removes beggars from the streets, providing eligible families a stipend of 2000 AFN per person monthly, encouraging those women to work reduces government spending on supporting unemployed women, resulting in an annual cost savings of at least 9600 million AFN.
If the female employment rate increases back to the former rate, the average household income is estimated to increase to approximately $3161.75
And over 50% surge in tax revenue is expected to happen.
Also an assumed support from (INGOs) for enhanced infrastructure development could potentially save the Taliban millions of dollars.
