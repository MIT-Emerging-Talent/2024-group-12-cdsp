# Retrospective

## Stop Doing 🙅‍♀️
- Presenting results without context or actionable recommendations.
- Overlooking the importance of visualizations and storytelling in communicating results effectively.
  
## Continue Doing 👍
- Tailoring communication of results to audience. Adjust our communication style and level of detail based on the audience. For example, focusing on key findings and broader implications for policymakers, while using more specific data and personal stories for advocacy groups.
- Incorporating personal narratives and real-life stories of women impacted by the restrictions, bringing a human dimension to the research and fostering empathy.
  
## Start Doing 🌟
- Depending on the audience and feasibility, consider translating key messages and materials into relevant languages for wider accessibility.
- Developing a plan for communication with audience (policy makers & advocacy groups), including updates on policy advocacy efforts and potential follow-up studies.

## Lessons Learned 💡
- Effective communication requires adaptation. Tailoring the message, format, and level of detail to the specific audience is critical for ensuring comprehension and impact.
- Engagement is key. Fostering interaction with the audience through various avenues encourages active participation and facilitates action-oriented responses.
