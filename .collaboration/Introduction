# Introduction
This project aims to comprehensively explore the repercussions of enforced restrictions on women's employment following the assumption of control by the Taliban. This transformative shift in the professional landscape has led to a significant loss of employment opportunities for women in Afghanistan.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

To assess and quantify the measurable socio-economic impact of restrictions on women's employment.
To generate meaningful insights that shed light on the challenges faced by women in the affected regions.
To lay the foundation for informed policy decisions and advocacy efforts aimed at fostering gender equality and enhancing economic opportunities for women in Afghanistan.

## Significance
The project holds substantial significance in understanding the complex interplay between socio-economic dynamics and gender-related policies. By delving into the consequences of women's employment restrictions, the study aims to contribute valuable insights that can inform not only the academic discourse but also drive practical and positive changes in policy frameworks.

## Context
The socio-political context of Afghanistan, particularly the recent changes in governance, forms the backdrop for this research. The assumed control by the Taliban has brought about unprecedented transformations, especially impacting the professional lives of women. This context underscores the urgency and relevance of investigating the socio-economic implications of women's employment restrictions.

## Scope
The project's scope encompasses a detailed analysis of the socio-economic landscape in Afghanistan, focusing on key indicators such as employment rates, household income, education, child marriages, and mental health. The research will draw insights from openly accessible online resources, international publications, and news articles to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

In summary, this project seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the socio-economic impact of women's employment restrictions in Afghanistan, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the discourse on gender equality and advocating for positive policy changes.
