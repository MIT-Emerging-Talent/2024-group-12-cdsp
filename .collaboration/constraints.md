# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

### Geographical Constraints:

The project may face challenges in reaching specific target geographic areas due to logistical hurdles.

### Technological Access:

Most women in some provinces of Afghanistan don’t have access to cellphones/laptops with the internet. This may impact the digital data collection process in the project.

### Government Regulations:

Due to current restrictions on women’s work and education, this project will not be supported or even prevented by government officials.

### Social and Political Factors:

Considerations related to social dynamics or political climates in the target regions influence the project's outreach and communication strategies.

### Timeline Restrictions:

Fixed delivery dates can serve as time constraints, adding pressure to meet project milestones.

### Resource Availability:

Lack of access to some data sources such as government records as the primary source is an external constraint affecting the data collection.

### Time Zone Differences:

Students working across different time zones may face challenges in coordinating meetings and collaborative activities. Scheduling regular synchronous meetings might be difficult due to time variations, requiring a flexible approach to communication and collaboration.

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

### Skill Disparities:

Students varying levels of expertise can be an involuntary internal constraint. Addressing skill gaps and providing necessary training may be required to ensure a cohesive and effective collaboration.

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
