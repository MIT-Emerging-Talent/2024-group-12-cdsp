The Taliban's restrictions on women's employment in Afghanistan have had cascading negative consequences, impacting not only individual women but also the entire society. The reduction in female labor force participation has led to a significant decline in household income, exacerbating poverty for many families. This economic hardship, coupled with limited opportunities, has contributed to an alarming rise in child marriages and child labor. Additionally, the restrictions have fueled displacement and migration, as families struggle to meet basic needs and seek safety for their daughters.

Beyond the economic and social repercussions, these restrictions undermine fundamental human rights and severely limit women's agency. Women are denied the opportunity to contribute their skills and talents to the workforce, stifling their economic independence and decision-making power. This erosion of gender equality not only harms individual women but also hinders the overall development and progress of the nation.
