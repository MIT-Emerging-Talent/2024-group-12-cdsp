# Research Design
This study adopts a mixed-methods approach, employing both quantitative and qualitative data to comprehensively assess the impact of the Taliban's restrictions on women's employment in Afghanistan. This approach allows for capturing the multifaceted nature of the issue, providing a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between policy, lived experiences, and societal consequences.

## Quantitative Data:
**Data Sources:** The study relies on established and reputable organizations like the World Bank, UNICEF, ILO, UN Women, Human Rights Watch, and UNHCR. This ensures data quality and reliability.

**Data Selection:** Specific data points were chosen to reflect key socio-economic indicators directly or indirectly affected by the restrictions. These indicators include household income, poverty levels, child marriage rates, child labor rates, displacement, and women's empowerment.

**Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics will be used to present and summarize the collected data, highlighting trends and patterns in these indicators before and after the implementation of the restrictions. Additionally, comparative analysis will be employed to examine potential correlations between the restrictions and the observed changes.
## Qualitative Data:

**Data Collection:** The study incorporates in-depth interviews conducted by credible organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and UNICEF with women directly impacted by the restrictions. The selection of diverse locations (Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif) ensures geographic representation.


**Data Analysis:** Thematic analysis is used to extract recurring themes and patterns from the interviews, providing insights into the lived experiences, challenges, and perspectives of affected women.
# Limitations and Addressing Challenges:

**Data Availability and Accuracy:** The study acknowledges the inherent limitations of relying on secondary data, including potential incompleteness or inaccuracies. To mitigate this, cross-verification from multiple reliable sources will be conducted. Additionally, the study will explicitly state any limitations associated with the data and its potential impact on the findings.

**Fluidity of the Situation:** The study recognizes the dynamic nature of the situation in Afghanistan and the possibility of evolving developments. The research acknowledges the need for updating the analysis based on new information as it becomes available. This transparency underscores the provisional nature of the findings and the importance of continuous monitoring of the situation.
