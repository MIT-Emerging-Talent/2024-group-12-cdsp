# The Socio-Economic Impact of Restrictions on Women's Employment in Afghanistan

After the Taliban's assumption of control, a notable transformation has unfolded in the professional landscape for women. The newfound constraints have resulted in a considerable number of women experiencing the loss of their employment opportunities. Analyzing the socio-economic impact of these restrictions not only sheds light on the challenges faced by women but also presents an invaluable opportunity to generate meaningful insights. These insights can serve as a foundation for informed policy decisions and advocacy efforts aimed at fostering gender equality and enhancing economic opportunities for women in the affected regions.


## Summary of Our Groupâ€™s Understanding of the Problem Domain

In Afghanistan, women face restrictions in accessing employment opportunities due to government policies. This limits their economic participation and perpetuates gender inequality. The problem statement aims to investigate the socio-economic impact of these restrictions and propose actionable interventions to improve women's employment prospects.


## Actionable Research Question

What is the measurable socio-economic impact of enforced restriction on women's employment in Afghanistan and how could the lifting of these restrictions contribute to economic development and gender equality?


## Non-technical Explanation of Modeling Approach and Possible Flaws

Given the constraint of relying solely on currently available online resources our modeling approach will heavily emphasize data aggregation, statistical analysis, and descriptive statistics. We'll focus on extracting quantitative information from the available sources to understand the socio-economic impact of enforced restrictions on women's employment in Afghanistan.

Possible flaws in this approach may include biased or incomplete information available online, potential limitations in the representativeness of the data, and the inability to capture qualitative nuances in the socio-economic impact through quantitative means alone.


## Documentation for the Data Set

The primary data source for our study is drawn from openly accessible online platforms, encompassing international organizations' publications, news articles, and reports from non-governmental organizations. This information is compiled into a structured dataset that includes key quantitative indicators such as employment rates and income levels. The original source of the dataset is provided to ensure transparency and facilitate verification. 
Despite the reliance on online sources, potential flaws in the dataset, such as issues related to reliability, reporting bias, or limitations in available quantitative information, have been addressed through rigorous cross-verification efforts.
