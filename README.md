# Unveiling the Impact: Women's Employment Restrictions in Afghanistan

We, Nasrin and Niloufar, are MIT Emerging Talent students diving into a critical issue: the impact of women's employment restrictions in Afghanistan. Join us as we analyze data, build models, and create visualizations to unveil the social and economic consequences of these restrictions.

This project goes beyond mere numbers. We seek to understand the human dimension, exploring how these restrictions affect individuals, families, and communities. Through our research, we aim to illuminate the path towards a brighter future, where gender equality and economic development flourish in Afghanistan.

Explore our journey of learning and discovery. Witness the impact of our work through insightful analysis, compelling models, and informative visualizations. Let's work together to understand the problem, envision solutions, and advocate for change.
