# Introduction
The Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 brought a swift and devastating rollback of women's rights, including severe restrictions on their employment opportunities. This study delves into the cascading socio-economic consequences of these restrictions, analyzing their impact on crucial indicators like household income, poverty levels, child marriage prevalence, child labor rates, and displacement.

Beyond the economic repercussions, these restrictions represent a fundamental violation of human rights and a significant setback for gender equality in Afghanistan. Women, who constitute half the population and possess immense potential to contribute to the nation's development, are now systematically excluded from the workforce, hindering their economic independence and agency.

This study aims to shed light on the multifaceted impact of these restrictions by examining various quantitative and qualitative data. By understanding the scope of the damage inflicted, we can advocate for effective solutions that promote gender equality, economic development, and respect for fundamental human rights in Afghanistan.
