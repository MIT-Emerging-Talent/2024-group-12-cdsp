# Potential Benefits of Lifting Restrictions
Lifting the restrictions on women's employment would unlock significant potential for Afghanistan's socio-economic development. It would:
### Boost household income and alleviate poverty
Increased female labor force participation would inject much-needed income into families, lifting them out of poverty and improving their overall well-being.
### Reduce child marriages and child labor
With greater economic opportunities for women, families would be less likely to resort to child marriages and child labor as coping mechanisms.
### Promote women's empowerment and gender equality
Allowing women to participate in the workforce would empower them economically and socially, fostering greater gender equality and respect for their rights.
### Enhance economic growth and stability
A larger and more diverse workforce would contribute to economic growth and stability, benefiting the entire nation.
