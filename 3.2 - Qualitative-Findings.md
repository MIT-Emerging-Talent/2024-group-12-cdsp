# Qualitative Findings
The qualitative findings, based on in-depth interviews with women impacted by the restrictions, provide rich insights into the lived experiences and challenges they face:

### Increased Economic Vulnerability
The loss of female income has severely impacted household finances, making it difficult to afford basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. This economic hardship has exacerbated existing inequalities and pushed many families deeper into poverty.

### Reduced Availability of Skilled Labor
The exclusion of women from the workforce has limited the pool of available skilled labor, potentially hindering economic growth and development. This loss of human capital can have long-term negative consequences for the Afghan economy.

### Deteriorating Health and Education Outcomes
Restrictions on women's access to healthcare and education have negatively impacted health indicators like maternal and infant mortality rates. Additionally, girls' education has been severely curtailed, limiting their future opportunities and perpetuating gender inequalities.

### Increased Gender-Based Violence
The restrictions have created a climate of fear and insecurity for women, making them more vulnerable to violence and abuse both within and outside the home. This violation of human rights has significant physical and psychological consequences for women and girls.

### Social Isolation and Stigmatization
The exclusion of women from public life has led to social isolation and marginalization, further limiting their agency and participation in society. This erosion of social fabric can have detrimental consequences for both individual well-being and community development.

### Psychological Distress
The restrictions have had a profound impact on women's mental health, with many experiencing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This psychological suffering requires urgent attention and support services to address the trauma and promote mental well-being.
